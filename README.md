# IMage ALIGN

Align source image with a reference image using OpenCV SIFT algorithm.

## Motivation

The task of aligning an image obtained by digitising a negative or slide with a direct digital capture of the same scene is often encountered in hybrid film/digital photography workflow. The applications include calibration of negative inversion algorithms or characterising film materials. Generally, the reference and source images have different resolution, aspect ratios, angle of view and can have a slight tilt. A script was needed that can perform this aligning task automatically.

## Installation

The `imalign` package is available from PyPI and can be installed by pip:

```bash
pip install imalign
```

## Usage

Once installed, the `imalign` script should be available in your terminal. Run

```bash
imalign --help
```

to see the list of command line arguments.

## Examples
